# RileysAdventureGame
This is a PyGame, Riley's Adventures, that I created for my niece for her 7th Birthday. 
It's a classic 2D platformer, the code is available but if you wish to just run it you'll find an executable in the dist folder

The controls are very simple, use arrow keys to navigate, spacebar to jump, p for Pause.
This also supports a PS4 controller, with the only different layout being L1 is Pause.
